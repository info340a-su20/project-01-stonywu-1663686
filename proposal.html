    <title>The best streamer of the month!</title>

    <h1>Problem/Data Domain</h1>
    <p>Nowadays, there are a lot of ways of entertainment available online and one of them is watching the streaming. Those who deliver the streaming are called 
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer">streamers</a></cite> 
        . The biggest streaming platform now in the US is 
        <cite><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a></cite> 
          which has 47 million active users per month. With more than 3 million monthly active streamers, it is hard for users to determine who to watch. Although the platform has its category based on the content of streaming, it is still not enough information for the user to decide as the platform will not list the streamer who is not streaming at that time.</p>
    <h1>App Description</h1>
    <p>My idea is to create an app that helps users to locate the possible streamer they would like to watch. The data will be acquired by the official site API. Each streamer page will include the following information.</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Streamer introduction(Edit by streamer/Directly from his personal page)</li>
		<li>Streaming contents(Can be multiple values)</li>
        <li>Streaming time(Schedule time/Actual streaming time during last month)</li>
        <li>Average audience counts</li>
        <li>Audience comments/ratings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Users can filter those information to locate the potential streamer they want to watch and comment/rate on the streamers' page.</p>
